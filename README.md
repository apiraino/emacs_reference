## EMACS reference

My personal, unfinished, ever work-in-progress and never-ending EMACS reference guide.

Because self-inflicted pain is the most pleasuring.

My setup basically consists in installing [prelude](https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude) and apply my customization to the `.emacs.d/personal/jman.el` file.

[Have a look at the guide](https://github.com/apiraino/emacs_reference/blob/master/guide.md) and feel free to suggest fixes, improvements, etc.
